# ft_strcpy

The `ft_strcpy` function is a custom implementation of the classic string copy function, designed to teach fundamental concepts of string manipulation in C programming. This repository contains the source code and documentation for `ft_strcpy`, which copies a source string into a destination buffer, ensuring the destination string is a perfect clone of the source.

## Description

`ft_strcpy` takes two arguments: a pointer to the destination buffer (`dest`) and a pointer to the source string (`src`). It iterates through each character of `src`, copying each into `dest`, and ensures the copied string is null-terminated. This function is an essential tool for understanding how strings are handled in C, highlighting the importance of null termination for string manipulation.
